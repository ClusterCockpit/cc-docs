The ClusterCockpit project is a collaborative effort to develop a job-specific
performance and power monitoring framework for HPC clusters. The NHR center NHR@FAU
is the lead developer with contributions from several other HPC centers. All
ClusterCockpit components are made available under the MIT open source license and are
freely available for download from our [GitHub page](https://github.com/ClusterCockpit).
In addition to software development, the ClusterCockpit project is also actively working on
establishing format and interface standards for HPC monitoring environments.


ClusterCockpit can be used as a complete integrated monitoring solution, but
components can also be integrated with external components. All components are
developed in the [Go](https://go.dev) programming language. The web frontend UI
is implemented as reusable [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) components.


ClusterCockpit is stable and is used in production at several large HPC
data centers. Contact us if you are interested in deploying ClusterCockpit at
your center. We can also help you plan and set up ClusterCockpit at your site.
